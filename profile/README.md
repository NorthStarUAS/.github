# NorthStar UAS

## Summary

This is a collection of all the UAS, flight control, EKF, ground station, data analysis, and mapping related work I've done since the middle 2000's.

## May 2023: Significant effort towards porting the arduipilot eco/build system version of the fmu back to arduino/teensy.

This means further development will not run on commodity pixhaw type hardware but will instead run on arduino and teensy style hardware.  This is more
interesting for me, enables development with more modern C++ constructs, and make all this code and all these concepts available to the wider arduino community.
